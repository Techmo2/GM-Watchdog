 This is the main code file for the watchdog timer class that contains the
 implementation of the code. The watchdog thread increments the timer every
 1000 microseconds (1 millisecond). If the timer's value makes it past
 1000 (1 second) before it it reset from the server thread, this indicates a 
 failure on the server thread. A mutex is used to prevent collisions when the
 timer's value is accessed from both threads.
 
 At the moment, the watchdog does nothing when a crash is detected. The action 
 taken has to be implemented based on the server's operation, and the desired 
 result.
